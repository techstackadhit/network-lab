# Multi-Site LAN with Static Routing

This project simulates a **company with multiple branch offices**, each having its own local network (LAN). The branches are connected through routers, forming a wide area network (WAN). Devices from one branch can communicate with devices in other branches using **static routing** configured on each router.

---

## Scenario Overview

A mid-sized company has **three locations**:
- **Head Office (HO)** â€“ Main location with HR & Finance
- **Branch A** â€“ Handles Sales team
- **Branch B** â€“ Handles Support team

Each site operates its own LAN with different subnets. Routers at each site are directly connected to each other over **serial point-to-point WAN links**. **Static routes** are configured manually on each router to enable full end-to-end connectivity.

This setup is built and tested using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

---

## Objectives

- Design and simulate a multi-branch LAN network.
- Assign unique subnets to each location.
- Interconnect sites using routers and WAN links.
- Configure static routes so all PCs can communicate.
- Verify connectivity across all sites.

---

## Tools & Devices Used

- 3x Cisco 2911 Routers
- 3x Cisco 2960 Switches
- 6x PC-PT Clients (2 per site)
- 2x Serial WAN Links (DCE/DTE)
- Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x

## Configuration Overview

### Router Configuration

Each router is responsible for:
- **Assigning IP addresses via DHCP** to its local LAN
- **Setting up static routes** to reach other branch networks
- **Configuring serial interfaces** for WAN links

#### Head Office (Router-HO)

- LAN IP: `192.168.10.1/24`
- DHCP Pool: 192.168.10.100â€“199
- Static routes:
  - To Branch A â†’ via `10.0.0.2`
  - To Branch B â†’ via `10.0.0.6`

#### Branch A (Router-A)

- LAN IP: `192.168.20.1/24`
- DHCP Pool: 192.168.20.100â€“199
- Static route:
  - To HO & Branch B â†’ via `10.0.0.1`

#### ðŸ”¹ Branch B (Router-B)

- LAN IP: `192.168.30.1/24`
- DHCP Pool: 192.168.30.100â€“199
- Static route:
  - To HO & Branch A â†’ via `10.0.0.5`

## Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue                                      | Solution                                           |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| PC doesnâ€™t receive IP                     | Check DHCP pool config & excluded address range    |
| Ping fails between branches               | Verify static routes on all routers                |
| Serial interfaces down                    | Ensure both ends are `no shutdown` + DCE has clock |
| Routing table incomplete                  | Check `show ip route` for missing networks         |
| PC can ping router but not other site     | Check if next-hop router has proper return routes  |

## Project Files

This project is available for download and simulation using [Cisco Packet Tracer](https://www.netacad.com/):

- [`packet-tracer/static-routing-multisite.pkt`](./packet-tracer)

**Included:**
- 3 routers with static routing configured
- Site-local DHCP and LAN setups
- Switches, PCs (DHCP-enabled), and testing PCs


---

## Notes

- This project simulates a small-scale **WAN interconnection** using static routing.
- Perfect as a base for:
  - Dynamic routing protocol (RIP, OSPF) upgrade
  - VPN or tunneling simulation (in more advanced tools)
  - Firewall rules between sites (via ACLs)

Tips:
- Label interfaces and IPs in your Packet Tracer file for clarity.
- Use `ping` and `traceroute` from each site to simulate real-world connectivity check.
- For bonus challenge: disable 1 WAN link and reroute manually.
