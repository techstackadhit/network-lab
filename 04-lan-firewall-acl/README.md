# VLAN + ACL – Office Network Access Control

This project builds on the VLAN + DHCP setup by introducing **Access Control Lists (ACLs)** to limit inter-VLAN communication. Specifically, we restrict **Guest VLAN (30)** from accessing internal departments like **HR (10)** and **IT (20)**, while still allowing HR and IT to communicate freely.

---

## Scenario Overview

Same 3 VLANs:
- **HR** (VLAN 10)
- **IT** (VLAN 20)
- **Guest** (VLAN 30)

All VLANs get IP via DHCP, and Router-on-a-Stick still provides inter-VLAN routing. Now, we implement ACL rules on the **router subinterfaces** to:
- Deny Guest VLAN → HR/IT
- Allow HR ↔ IT
- Allow Guest → Internet or ping router (optional)

---

## Objectives

- Create ACLs to restrict access **from Guest VLAN (30)** to others
- Apply ACLs to router interfaces using `ip access-group`
- Validate that Guest users **cannot access** internal resources
- Keep HR & IT communication functional

---

## Tools & Devices Used

- Cisco 2911 Router (with ACL config)
- Cisco 2960 Switch
- 6x PC-PT clients
- Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x

## ACL Policy Plan

| Source VLAN | Destination VLAN | Access   | Rule                 |
|-------------|------------------|----------|----------------------|
| Guest (30)  | HR (10)          | Deny  | Block via ACL        |
| Guest (30)  | IT (20)          | Deny  | Block via ACL        |

## Configuration Overview

### Router (2911)

- G0/0 with subinterfaces:  
  - `.10` → VLAN 10  
  - `.20` → VLAN 20  
  - `.30` → VLAN 30
- DHCP Pools defined for each VLAN (same as previous project)
- ACL applied to VLAN 30 (Guest) to block access to HR and IT
- Excluded addresses configured to reserve gateways

### Switch (2960)

- VLANs created: 10, 20, 30
- Trunk port to router (Fa0/7)
- Access ports assigned per department

### PCs

- IP Config set to DHCP (automatic)
- Receive IPs based on connected VLAN

## Configuration Files

All device configurations are available in the [`config/`](./config) folder.

| Device | File                         |
|--------|------------------------------|
| Router | [`config/router-config.txt`](./config/router-config.txt)   |
| Switch | [`config/switch-config.txt`](./config/switch-config.txt)   |
| PCs    | DHCP auto (no manual config) |

Each configuration includes:
- DHCP pools for each subnet
- VLANs and access port mapping
- Subinterfaces with 802.1Q encapsulation
- ACL rules and application

## Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue                            | Solution                                       |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ACL not working                  | Ensure `ip access-group` applied on interface |
| Guest can still ping HR/IT	     | Check ACL rule order and direction (inbound)  |
| Legit traffic also blocked       | Make sure last rule is `permit ip any any`    |
| Inter-VLAN ping fails (HR/IT)    | Verify trunk and subinterface status          |

## ACL Inbound vs Outbound – Behavior Explanation

When applying ACLs on router interfaces, the **direction of application (`in` or `out`) affects the type of response when traffic is denied**:

| Direction | What happens when ACL denies traffic        | Result seen by user         |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `in`      | Traffic is blocked **as it enters** the router | Destination Host Unreachable |
| `out`     | Traffic is blocked **before it exits** the router | Request Timed Out (RTO)      |

### Why This Happens:
- When using `ip access-group BLOCK_GUEST in` on a subinterface (e.g., G0/0.30), **ICMP Echo Requests from Guest get denied before even entering the router**, and the router **generates an ICMP "Destination Unreachable"** message in response.
- If the ACL is placed outbound (e.g., on G0/0.10 going out to HR), the packet is accepted initially, but dropped before exiting — so **no response is generated**, leading to a classic **RTO (Request Timed Out)**.

### Best Practice:
Inbound ACLs are **preferred** for controlling who gets in from specific subnets (e.g., restricting Guest VLAN), and also make it easier to **trace deny messages** during testing.
