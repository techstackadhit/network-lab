# ðŸ§ª Network Lab Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of hands-on network simulations and lab exercises built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, designed to simulate real-world network scenarios.

It follows a progressive structure â€” from basic LAN setups to advanced configurations like VLANs, DHCP, ACLs, and network monitoring.
