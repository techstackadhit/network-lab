# üñß Basic LAN Setup for a Small Office with Internet Access

This project simulates a simple local area network (LAN) setup for a small office with two departments: **Administration** and **Production**. Each department has its own switch and a group of PCs, all connected to a central router that provides internet access using **NAT (Network Address Translation)**.

The simulation is built using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Create a segmented LAN for two departments using two switches.
- Assign static IP addresses to all client devices.
- Connect the internal LANs to the internet through a router.
- Implement NAT on the router so internal IPs can access the internet.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Devices Used

- Cisco 2911 Router
- 2x Cisco 2960 Switches
- 6x PC-PT Clients
- 1x Server (as Internet simulation)
- Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x

## üåê Network Topology

- **Admin Network**: `192.168.10.0/24`
- **Production Network**: `192.168.20.0/24`
- Internet: 8.8.8.0/24

## üß† Internet Simulation in Packet Tracer

Since Cisco Packet Tracer doesn't provide real internet access, this project includes a simulated internet setup using a local server device.

### ‚úÖ How It Works:

- A local server is assigned the IP `8.8.8.8` to mimic Google DNS.
- The router connects directly to this server using the same subnet (`8.8.8.0/24`).
- DNS service is enabled on the server with domain mappings:
  - `google.com` ‚Üí `8.8.8.8`
  - `youtube.com` ‚Üí `8.8.8.8`
- HTTP and HTTPS service is also enabled so clients can browse using Packet Tracer's web browser.

This allows client PCs to resolve domain names and access a mock internet environment realistically.

## üîß Configuration Overview

### Router (2911)

- Interface G0/0 ‚Üí Internet (`8.8.8.1`)
- Interface G0/1 ‚Üí Admin LAN (`192.168.10.1`)
- Interface G0/2 ‚Üí Production LAN (`192.168.20.1`)
- NAT configured for both internal networks

## üîß Configuration Files

All device configurations are available in the [`config/`](./config) folder.

| Device   | File                          |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Router   | `config/router-config.txt`    |
| Switch 1 | `config/switch-admin.txt`     |
| Switch 2 | `config/switch-production.txt`|
| PCs      | Manual IP setup (see [IP Plan](#-ip-address-plan)) |

Each configuration includes:
- Interface setup
- NAT and IP assignment
- VLANs (if applicable)
- Any additional settings per project scope

## üß© Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue                           | Solution                            |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| No internet access               | Check NAT configuration             |
| No ping between PCs              | Check cable type, interface status  |
| No default gateway               | Ensure PCs have the correct gateway |
